## Overview of Labs

### 🔹 **Lab-1: RTL Coding & Simulation**
Design and simulate basic digital building blocks:
- Adder, counter, flip-flops
- Functional simulation with Cadence NCLaunch

### 🔹 **Lab-2: Logic Synthesis**
Perform RTL synthesis and analyze reports:
- Synthesis flow with constraints
- Timing, area & power reports

### 🔹 **Lab-3: Script-Driven Synthesis**
Enhance synthesis automation:
- Constraint scripting
- Gate-level netlist generation

### 🔹 **Lab-4: Datapath + Control Design**
Build complex logic:
- Arithmetic units (multipliers, GCD, Booth)
- FSM (Finite State Machines) for control

### 🔹 **Lab-5: Physical Design**
Introduce backend ASIC flow:
- Floorplanning, Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS), routing
- Integrate CPU datapath

### 🔹 **Lab-6: Verification & Physical Implementation**
End-to-end verification:
- Pre/Post-synthesis validation
- Physical design of a 2×2 multiplier
